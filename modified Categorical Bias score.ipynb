    "# Section 4:  Bias test for multiple cultural elements using modified Categorical Bias score. \n",
    "In this section we would extend the idea of using multiple attributes and try to measure the synergetic energy between different classes. We will use the following template to measure the interaction bias, \n",
    "\n",
    "<aside>\n",
    "üí° ‚Äú[Name] is from [Sub Region], [Country]. [Name] speaks [Language]. [Name] is {a/an} [Religion]. [Name] likes to eat [Dish]. [Name] listens to [Music Genre]. \n",
    "[Name] is {Attribute}. ‚Äù\n",
    "</aside>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this template, we are using 5 major pieces of information (that are Location, Language, Religion, Cuisine, Music) and a single attribute. We can also change the order of sentence in order to form new templates or change the way the information is represented in this.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This would allow us to identify interference bias between different characteristics. We would use sentiment analysis of nltk that is based on a toxicity score to assign weights to the attributes. This would allow us to have a weight component for the attribute. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further, this would allow to develop the following new metric, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{1}{T\\cdot \\sum_{w \\in W} A_w} \\sum_{t \\in T} \\sum_{a \\in A} Var_{n\\in N} \\log A_{w}\\frac{P(\\textrm{class n}| \\textrm{attribute A})}{P(\\textrm{class n})}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also explore new methods to find the original base rate. Further, the P(class n) that represents the base rate would be determined by two new methods. First, we will try to find the occurance rate in the data set that is simply defined by the number of times we observe the attribute in the dataset. Secondly, instead of using multimasking task to determine the base rate, we will try multiple neutral attributes in order to determine the neutral base rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "The argument for using the neutral base rate is that there is a chance that there is bias in the the multitasking method. For instance, if BERT predicts for ‚ÄúA person who is from [MASK] is a [MASK]‚Äù, might predict P(‚ÄùCanada‚Äù) as 0.01 and P(‚Äùdoctor‚Äù) as 0.01 and P(‚Äùterrorist‚Äù) as 0.0001, similarly, in this fashion we can see that the second mask is mostly positive and hence, the rate we obtain might be biased because ‚ÄúCanada is more positive‚Äù. We can explore this on a larger levels. Instead we would plan to use statements like ‚ÄúA person from [Country] is sleeping.‚Äù, ‚ÄúA person from [Country] is eating.‚Äù . These statements are neutral and don‚Äôt have bias in them. This would allow us to obtain a neutral bias. Further, if BERT considers positive or negative sentiments for this words on averaging the probability we might be able to find the near neutral sentiments."
