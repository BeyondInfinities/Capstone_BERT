    "# Understanding Culture\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining culture is a hard task. It has no one clear defination but rather has multiple definitions that can be used in many different context. Culture can be broken down into multiple components like language, traditions, religious beliefs, spiritual beliefs, food, music, and many others. However, one thing that is common among all the cultural elements is that they are passed through communication between people. \n",
    "\n",
    "A single person can belong to multiple cultures and can even create their own culural identity. Culture is not static and is constantly changing through time, places, people and many other factors. Over the past millenia, culture has changed drastically and will continue to change in the future. We want to focus on how culture plays a role in English language?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Differnet Varieties of English\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about English, it is almost not a single language. There are many dialects, accents, and variations of English that are spoken around the world. The most common dialects of English are American English, British English, Australian English, and Indian English. These dialects are not mutually intelligible and are different in many ways. For example, the word \"color\" is pronounced as \"colour\" in British English and \"color\" in American English. The word \"theater\" is pronounced as \"theatre\" in Indian English and \"theater\" in American English. There is also variations like Black English Vernacular, Cockney English, and many others spoken by communites around the world and that is considered harsh by the mainstream English speakers. In fact, a lot of the slang words that are used in the Black English Vernacular are considered to be vulgar in other countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has huge implications for the minorities that speak these languages, it creates a social pressure that the way they speak is vulgar and marginalizes them. In fact, majority of the NLP models are trained on English that does not include African American Vernacular English. This bias propagates in the models and creates a bias in the models. This is a huge problem and needs to be addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thinking about other lingual speakers\n",
    "\n",
    "Culture can also be defined by languages. Language is an integral part of culture as it dictates the way people communicate with each other. It leads to spread of ideas, beliefs, and values. Language is also a way to identify people and their culture. For example, if you are speaking in Hindi, people will assume that you are from India. If you are speaking in Spanish, people will assume that you are from Spain. If you are speaking in English, people will assume that you are from the United States. This is a huge problem as it creates a bias in the way models think about other cultures. For instance, when we ask BERT what else is a hypothetical spanish speaker. It replies with chrisitian.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result can have serious implications in real life situations as NLP models are being deployed to help people in their daily lives. For example, if a spanish speaker is looking for necklaces, the model will implicitly assume that they are a christian and suggest crucifix."

    "# Thinking about food \n",
    "\n",
    "Food is an integral part in our lives and everyone needs food in order to survive. Hence, many cultures around the world developed different cuisines, dishes, to serve the needs of food. Food is also an identity, it brings people together and creates a sense of belonging. Now there are many times the model will assume about food cultures. For instance, eating with hands is normal in South Asian cultures but it is considered to be rude in the western cultures. Hence, the model will tend to assume that eating with hands is rude and will not suggest it to the user. As we can see it in the example below. "
